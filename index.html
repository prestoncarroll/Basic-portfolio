<p1>Hi! My name is Preston Carroll. I was born and raised in New Orleans Louisiana, but now i currently live in Baton Rouge. My beautiful fiance Julia and I live in a single story house with a pet cat named Baby Boy. On September twenty eighth I turned twenty three years old but i feel older. Transfering my career to the tech field is something I've been wanting to do but wasn't able to supply the funds for it. I'm very excited to start this new journey with a great team on side of me!
